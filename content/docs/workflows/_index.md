Mass spectrometry data processing is highly application-focused, and MassCube is designed to support this by integrating individual functions and modules into workflows. These pre-defined workflows simplify and accelerate data processing and analysis for specific applications.

Wondering how to contribute to the workflows? Please refer to the [contribution guide](masscubedocs/contribute).
