Mass spectrometry data processing is application-oriented. MassCube supports flexible data processing workflows by combining individual functions and modules. The pre-defined workflows are designed to streamline data processing and analysis for specific applications.

To achieve this, we offer a series of pre-defined workflows that can be used as command line applications.

Wondering how to contribute to the workflows? Please refer to the [contribution guide](/contribute).
