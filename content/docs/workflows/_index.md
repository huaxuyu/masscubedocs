Mass spectrometry data processing is application-oriented, tailored to meet the specific needs of diverse scientific investigations. 

One of the main purposes of MassCube is to provide a flexible and robust data processing framework that can be adapted to various applications. To achieve this, we offer a series of pre-defined workflows that can be used as command line applications.

The pre-defined workflows are combinations of the core functions in MassCube. We encourage users to explore the workflows and customize them to meet their specific needs.

Wondering how to contribute to the workflows? Please refer to the [contribution guide](../contribution).
