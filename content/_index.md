## MassCube enables

* **Untargeted feature detection**
    * Accurate and comprehensive feature detection, with accurate annotation of isotopes, charge states,
    adducts, and in-source fragments.

* **Comprehensive feature evalution**
    * Understand chromatographic peak shapes using Gaussian similarity, noise score, asymmetry factor and more.

* **Compound annotation and analog search**
    * Ultra-fast annotation of MS/MS spectra with high confidence, suppoted by entropy similarity.

* **Data visualization**
    * Visualize the data in a variety of ways and generate publication-quality graphs, including chromatograms, 
    single spectrum, MS/MS matching plots, PCA plots and more.
   
* **Flexible development and implementation**
    * A variety of fundemental algorithms are available for flexible usage, including data normalization, network analysis, and statistical analysis.
