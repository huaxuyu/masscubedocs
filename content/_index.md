    adducts, and in-source fragments.

* Compound annotation and analog search
    * Ultra-fast annotation of MS/MS spectra with high confidence, suppoted by entropy similarity.

* Data visualization
    * Visualize the data in a variety of ways and generate publication-quality graphs, including chromatograms, 
    single spectrum, MS/MS matching plots, and molecular networks.
   
* Tools for data analysis
    *A variety of tools for data analysis, including data normalization, missing value imputation, and statistical analysis.
