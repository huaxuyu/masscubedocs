Click here to download the Python 3.11. Installation of masscube The easiest way to install the masscube python package is using pip. Open terminal and run\npip install masscube Dependencies will be automatically installed. This progress may take several minutes. Consider creating a virtual environment if you’re working with Python on multiple projects.","the-oneclick-untargeted-metabolomics-workflow#The OneClick Untargeted Metabolomics workflow":"Finish the complete untargeted metabolomics workflow (Fig. 1) with a single line of command.\nFig. 1. The OneClick workflow Input Organize the files of a project (i.e. my_project) in a folder\nmy_project ├── data │ ├── sample1.mzML │ ├── sample2.mzML | └── ... |── sample_table.csv └── parameters.csv There are three types of data\ndata folder: a subfolder containing all raw MS data in mzML or mzXML format. It’s mandatory. sample_table.csv file: a csv file to claim the name of samples and their groups including biological groups, quality control samples, or blank samples. An example is here. It’s mandatory. parameters.csv file: a csv file to set parameters for the workflow. An example is here. It’s optional. If not provided, the default parameters will be applied. See Parameters for more details. Processing Within the project folder, open terminal and run\nuntargeted-metabolomics ⚠️ Make sure the terminal directory is the peoject folder. For Windows user and MacOS user Output A set of output files will be provided in the project folder depending on the parameters settings. The general output will be\nproject/ ├── data ├── sample_table.csv ├── parameters.csv ├── project.mc ├── aligned_feature_table.csv ├── single_file_output │ ├── sample1.csv │ ├── sample2.csv │ └── ... ├── chromatogram │ ├── sample1.png │ ├── sample2.png │ └── ... ├── ms2_matching │ ├── compound1.png │ ├── compound2.png │ └── ... ├── statistics ├── ... project.mc file: the project file of masscube. aligned_feature_table.csv file: feature table after alignment. single_file_output folder: a file folder containing the detected features from individual files. chromatogram folder: a file folder to store base peak chromatograms (BPCs) for individual files. ms2_matching folder: mirror plot of MS2 matching results. statistics folder: results from statistical analysis. For example, principal component analysis plots.
