However, setting parameters are often challenging, especially for beginners or scientists who are not familiar with the MS data.\nmasscube automatically read the MS data and apply the corresponding default parameters. Users can also customize the parameters by providing a parameter file.\nStep 2. Load sample table and organize data A sample table is used to claim the name of samples and their groups. In most metabolomics studies, quality control samples and blank samples are included. masscube automatically apply normalization and statistical analysis if the sample table is provided.\nStep 3. Single file processing Individual files are processed for feature detection, which envolves the detection of peak apex, edges, area, and related MS/MS spectra. It also includes the determination of isotopes, charge states, adducts, and in-source fragments.\nTo accelerate the processing, masscube supports parallel computing for multiple files. By default, the number of threads is set to be the 80% (cpu_ratio=0.8) of the total CPU cores so that the computer can still be used for other tasks.\nTo control the memory usage, the files are processed in batches. The default batch size is 100 (batch_size=100).\nMore details about the feature detection can be found here.\nStep 4. Feature alignment Feature alignment aims to match the same feature across different samples. The alignment is based on the mass-to-charge ratio and retention time. The mass tolerance and retention time tolerance are critical for the alignment. See alignment for more details.\nStep 5. Gap filling Gap filling is critical for the downstream statistical analysis, and missing values are treated by forced peak detection. See gap filling for more details.\nStep 6. MS/MS annotation Compound annotation was performed by matching the experimental MS/MS spectra with the MS/MS library. The MS/MS similarity score is generated to indicate the confidence of the annotation.\nFlash entropy search is used to accelerate the annotation. masscube also provides analog search (i.e. hybrid search) for unknown discovery. See annotation for more details.\nStep 7. Normalization Two types of normalization could be needed in metabolomics to address the systematic signal drifts and the sample-to-sample variation (i.e. total amount/concentration difference). masscube provides multiple post-acquisition normalization algorithms to address the normalization issue. See normalization for more details.\nStep 8. Statistical analysis Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis will be performed if sample table is provided. The results will be saved in the statistics folder. See statistics for more details.\nStep 9. Data visualization Users can choose to plot the base peak chromatogram (BPC) to verify possible bad injections or outliers. The MS/MS matching plots are generated for the annotated compounds. PCA plots are generated for the statistical analysis. See visualization for more details.","introduction#Introduction":"Data processing is critical for metabolomics studies.
